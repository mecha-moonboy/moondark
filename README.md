# Moondark
## Aiming to be the ultimate fantasy experience for Minetest
The base game is beginning with a unique design philosophy unlike Minec**** or Minetest Game. A number of features herald a new brand of experience in voxel games. Build more frameworks on top of what is there with little regard for the compared features of other games and complete focus on simplicity and ease-of-use and ease-of-play:

APIs:
- Herbs: register and generate herbs given particular conditions, for intelligent gameplay and rare ingredients.
- Astrology: Seasons, Moon phases, (planned seasonal block changes, and planets).
- Status Effects: Register status effects and activate them. My alternative to a hunger or sprint system.
- Node Critters: Register blocky friends to make your world a little more crunchy.

Features:
- QOL mods (weilded light, wood cutting, gridless craft).
- Large trees (that's a big one for some people, myself included).
- Higher/lower terrain than default valleys mapgen.
- Rake: Because who wants to spend 2 minutes picking up a few dozen sticks? (Credits to Warr's Nodecore for the idea, implementation varied greatly.)
- In-theme hotbar and hearts/bubbles
- Stone tools and starter ingredients.

These are just a few of many systems being given a boilerplate implementation and demo features. The goal is to make a fantasy-themed abstraction layer on top of the engine that is easy to use and learn. Eventually, a fully fledged game may begin serious development. Until then, here's some spoilers I have to rope you in:
- Environmental Effects API: nodes, map variables, and various other factors could effect the player in a number of ways.
- Conduct API: Player behavior can disrupt a delicate balance between matter and spirit, making nature react in self-defense.
- Mob API: A mob API build from the ground up to offer a diverse array of tools.
- Smithing System: No more furnaces to melt your metal ores like butter, have fun stoaking and containing a forge fire! ... Of varying sizes...
