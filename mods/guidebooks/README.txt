-- Adding a section
currently a maximum of 28 sections per index is supported, meaning a book can store 784 sections if all of the sections in the main index are masters.
(this can be circumvented by building custom directories using the 'extra' field of a page, but is not recommended)

guideBooks.Common.register_section(
	"modname:itemname",             -- The name of a registered book
	"section_1",                    -- The name to give the section, only string values supported
	{                               -- A list of preset values (you could also put page definitions here.)
		description="Section 1",    --- The display name of the section
		hidden=false,               --- Whether the section is visible in the main index (set to true to hide)
		master=false,               --- Whether this section leads to an index (set to true to create a new index under this section)
		slave=false,                --- Set to false to show in the main index, set to the name of another section to show in that index. cannot be used with master=true
		Pages={                		--- The pages to preload into the section (use only for certain instances when required)
			Index={}                ---- A special page used only by the 'Main' section that loads after the cover
		},
		locked=false                --- If this is true, only players with the meta field <bookItem>:<sectionName>:unlocked=="true" will be able to see this section
	}
)

The sections 'Hidden' and 'Main' exist in any book by default

-- adding pages
guideBooks.Common.register_page(
	"modname:itemname",                                       -- The name of a registered book
	"section_1",                                              -- The name of a section in the book
	1,                                                        -- the page number (or name in the case of special pages such as Index)
	{                                                         -- content definition
		textcolor="cyan"                                      -- the color of the text. If specified, it overrides the general textcolor for this very page
		text1="foo bar",                                      --- the text to display on the first half of the page
		text2="lorem ipsum dolor sit amet",                   --- the text to display on the second half of the page
		extra="background[0,0;5,8;modname_image.png;false]"   --- A minetest formspec string used to add extra content to a page, such as an image
	}
)

The page 'Index' exists in the 'Main' section by default but can be overriden.
